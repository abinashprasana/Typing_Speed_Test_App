Bite off more than you can chew.
Hit the nail on the head.
Let the cat out of the bag.
Spill the beans.
Break the ice.
Burn the midnight oil.
Caught between a rock and a hard place.
Kick the bucket.
The ball is in your court.
Under the weather.
A blessing in disguise.
Beat around the bush.
Cost an arm and a leg.
Once in a blue moon.
The best of both worlds.
You can’t have your cake and eat it too.
Pull someone’s leg.
Speak of the devil.
Steal someone’s thunder.
Let sleeping dogs lie.
A stitch in time saves nine.
Look before you leap.
No pain, no gain.
Birds of a feather flock together.
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
You can't make an omelet without breaking eggs.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
He who laughs last laughs best.
Jack of all trades, master of none.
A friend in need is a friend indeed.
Haste makes waste.
Money doesn't grow on trees.
Necessity is the mother of invention.
Time and tide wait for no man.
Curiosity killed the cat.
You reap what you sow.
It's no use crying over spilt milk.
I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.
May the Force be with you.
To be, or not to be, that is the question.
All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.
Not all those who wander are lost.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.
Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.
Et tu, Brute?
Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
The ends justify the means.
It is better to be feared than loved, if you cannot be both.
A man who stands for nothing will fall for anything.
Elementary, my dear Watson.
You talking to me?
Houston, we have a problem.
Why so serious?
Here's looking at you, kid.
Life is like a box of chocolates.
